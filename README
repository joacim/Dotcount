Dotcount counts black separate regions (dots) in an image, reports the dot
perimeter and approximates the diameter on the assumption that all dots are
circular.

The marching squares algorithm encapsulates each identified region (dot) in
a unique path. This path defines the identified dot's perimeter.

Dotcount was written entirely by myself in my spare time. This code is the
result of my own ideas and knowledge of the marching squares algorithm.
Dotcount started as a rewrite of Tom Giabara's implementation of the
algorithm released in the public domain.

Dotcount was created to help my wife with her PhD work. She extracted
quantum dot densities and sizes from SEM images using only pen and paper.
