{"name":"Dotcount","tagline":"Dotcount is a simple cli program to count dots in an image.","body":"Dotcount counts black separate regions (dots) in an image, reports the dot\r\nperimeter and approximates the diameter on the assumption that all dots are\r\ncircular.\r\n\r\nThe marching squares algorithm encapsulates each identified region (dot) in\r\na unique path. This path defines the identified dot's perimeter.\r\n\r\nDotcount was written entirely by myself in my spare time. This code is the\r\nresult of my own ideas and knowledge of the marching squares algorithm.\r\nDotcount started as a rewrite of Tom Giabara's implementation of the\r\nalgorithm released in the public domain.\r\n\r\nDotcount was created to help my wife with her PhD work. She extracted\r\nquantum dot densities and sizes from SEM images using only pen and paper.\r\n\r\nJoacim Thomassen, 30-7-2011\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
