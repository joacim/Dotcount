Thanks to Tom Gibara for implementing the Marching Squares algorithm and 
releasing his work into the public domain. Reading and understanding the 
algorithm through his implementation saved me some valuable time during 
my own re-implementation.

Thanks to my wife Sedsel Fretheim Thomassen for her feedback and support.
