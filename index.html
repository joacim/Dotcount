      <p>Dotcount counts black separate regions (dots) in an image, reports the dot
perimeter and approximates the diameter on the assumption that all dots are
circular.</p>

<p>The marching squares algorithm encapsulates each identified region (dot) in
a unique path. This path defines the identified dot's perimeter.</p>

<p>Dotcount was written entirely by myself in my spare time. This code is the
result of my own ideas and knowledge of the marching squares algorithm.
Dotcount started as a rewrite of Tom Giabara's implementation of the
algorithm released in the public domain.</p>

<p>Dotcount was created to help my wife with her PhD work. She extracted
quantum dot densities and sizes from SEM images using only pen and paper.</p>
