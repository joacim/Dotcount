This software was built and tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS GNU/Linux


## Users: Using dotcount as it is ##

Dotcount depends on another software component, the NetPBM library.
Ubuntu will install this component for you if you search for libnetpbm10
in the Ubuntu Software Center and select install. 

Copy the pre-built dotcount executable to your system's program path:

sudo cp /media/<MY_MEDIA>/bin/dotcount /usr/local/bin/dotcount

(replace '<MY_MEDIA>' by the cdrom/usb name given to your media 
containing Dotcount)

If the pre-built executable somehow has been altered it might have lost
something called the executable flag. To re-gain this flag you write:

sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/dotcount

(if the flag was present, nothing happens - so don't worry)

Now you're ready to start using dotcount.


## Developers: Making changes and building the executable yourself ##

To build dotcount from source you will need the software components:
  build-essential
  libnetpbm10-dev

They provide the g++ compiler for building and the development library
for NetPBM with header files like /usr/include/pam.h.

You build dotcount from source with:
make

Install your latest build to your system's program path with:
sudo make install

Your self built version of dotcount is know installed on your system, 
and you're ready to start using it.
