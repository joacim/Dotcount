Do the required image preparations in a photo editor like the GIMP.

Required properties for the prepared input image:
	* .pnm format
	* greyscale (depth = 1)
	* binary => two different sample values (black:0, white:255)
	* 8-bit samples
Please read the documentation for more details regarding the preparations.

Running Dotcount from the command line without any arguments will prompt
the user with the arguments Dotcount expect, like this:

Usage: dotcount <prepared_image.pnm> <original_image.pnm> <nm_scale>
		<px_scale>
